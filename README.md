# Adaptive dynamic programming fundamental algorithms

Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problem of optimal control for continuous-time and discrete-time nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of ADP fundamental algorithms, including iterative ADP and online ADP, are provided.
