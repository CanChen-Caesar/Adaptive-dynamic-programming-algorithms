# Adaptive dynamic programming
Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problems of optimal control for discrete-time (DT) and continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of fundamental ADP algorithms, including iterative and online ADP, are provided. 
 
 Currently added ADP algorithms include:
 - Value iteraion for DT systems
 - Policy iteration for DT systems
 - Integral reinforcement learning (IRL) for CT systems
