# Adaptive dynamic programming
Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problems of optimal control for discrete-time (DT) and continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of ADP, including iterative and online ADP, are provided. Currently added ADP algorithms include:
 - [Value iteraion for DT systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4554208)
 - [Policy iteration for DT systems](https://books.google.com.hk/books?hl=zh-CN&lr=&id=U3Gtlot_hYEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Optimal+Control&ots=wcdkz1Auhq&sig=YyFMovodt3yzTBi2eD17pS5jilM&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=policy%20iteration&f=false)
 - [Integral reinforcement learning (IRL) for CT systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608009000446)
