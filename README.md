# Adaptive dynamic programming
Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problems of optimal control for discrete-time (DT) and continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of ADP, including iterative and online ADP, are provided. Currently added ADP algorithms include:
 - [Value iteraion for DT systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4554208)
 - [Value iteraion a positive semi definite initial value function for DT systems]([https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4554208](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7314890))
 - [Policy iteration for DT systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6609085)
 - [Integral reinforcement learning for partially unknown CT systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608009000446)
 - Model-free integral reinforcement learning for completely unknown CT nonaffine systems
 - [Parallel control-based optimal tracking for CT nonaffine systems](https://www.ieee-jas.net/en/article/doi/10.1109/JAS.2020.1003426)
