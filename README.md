# Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning (ADPRL) for nonlinear optimal control
Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problems of optimal control for discrete-time (DT) and continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of ADPRL, including iterative and online ADPRL, are provided. Currently added ADPRL algorithms include:
