# Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning (ADPRL) for nonlinear optimal control
Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problems of optimal control for discrete-time (DT) and continuous-time (CT) nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of ADP, including iterative and online ADP, are provided. Currently added ADP algorithms include:
 - [Value iteraion for DT systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4554208)
 - [Value iteraion (positive semi definite initial value function) for DT systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7314890)
 - [Policy iteration for DT systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6609085)
 - [Integral reinforcement learning for partially unknown CT systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608009000446)
 - Model-free integral reinforcement learning for completely unknown CT nonaffine systems
 - [Online learning policy update for DT systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6208889)
